# Troubleshooting

- If setup.py fails try this:
  - ```bash
    pip3 install termcolor beautifulsoup4 prettytable halo
    ```

- If you're getting an error like <code>`sudo: python: command not found`</code>
   - ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/trakBan/spongebob-cli.git; cd spongebob-cli; sudo chmod +x spongebob-cli; sudo python3 setup.py install
     ```
   - Use python3 instead of python


- Gentoo users will have to add --user at the end of that line of code

- If the video won't play check if you have mpv and youtube-dl installed.
- If you don't have youtube-dl but a fork of it, make a alias in your .zshrc or .bashrc and alias it to youtube-dl
